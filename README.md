FREEMI: A chrome extension designed to help you stay on task!

Inspiration
In today's digital age, the average person spends nearly 7 hours a day online. Online addiction and procrastination are serious problems, especially in youth. It's become so bad that a study found that 40% of youth reported having a social media addiction. How did it come to this?

Well, there is no mystery to this phenomenon, it is actually exactly what some people work towards. Modern companies spend millions of dollars making social media that is as addictive as possible and keeps you hooked. Their end game is to squeeze out as much money as they can from users, but at what cost to the user?

What it does
This is where Freemi comes in. It is a google chrome extension that lets users block certain websites they find addictive and also provides motivation to keep those sites blocked by shining a light on how many times we actually go to these sites.

One of Freemi's main features is a big heatmap showing how many times the extension blocked a site that day. This gives users a big picture view of their browsing habits they might not realize without the help from these visualizations.

Another one of Freemi's features is a helpful AI friend that will motivate you to stay focused and avoid distractions. Freemi AI can help you stay accountable and tries to get you to self-reflect on why you feel the need to constantly go on social media.

How we built it
Freemi was built using React, javascript, openai's API, and most importantly the Google Chrome extension API. One of the main objectives with Freemi was to make it as easy as possible to install and use, allowing us to help the biggest possible group of people. That is why we decided to make Freemi a google chrome extension, which allows anyone with a browser to easily access it.

Challenges we ran into
A lot of time was spent getting the design right, and making it as easy to use as possible. We went through multiple iterations to reach our final design but ended up scrapping many ideas which cost us a lot of time. Another challenge we faced was working with the chrome browser API, since none of us had experience with it. We had to spent some time upfront to get familiar with it so that we could build the features we had in mind.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We as a team are really proud of creating something that tries to tackle a very relevant issue in today's society. We hope Freemi has a positive impact and if it helps even just one person to cut down their social media time we as a team would be very happy!

What we learned
We learned a lot about UI/UX while trying to make Freemi a seamless experience. We focused on a few flows users would go through and ensured they were extremely intuitive.
